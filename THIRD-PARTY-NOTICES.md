# Third-party artwork and build tools

## Google Material Icons

The first-party Material icon catalog contains the used, unmodified SVG path data from Google Material Icons, distributed under the Apache License 2.0. Copyright Google LLC. The pinned extraction is from MudBlazor 9.0.0's Material icon constants; MudBlazor source is MIT licensed, copyright MudBlazor contributors.

Original artwork and license: <https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/LICENSE>.
MudBlazor source and license: <https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/blob/v9.0.0/LICENSE>.

The icon snapshot in `scripts/icons/material-icon-paths.json` supports deterministic generation after removal of the UI package. The SVG artwork is not modified.

## Native CSS utilities

The used base and spacing/display utilities in `native-utilities.css` retain snippets from MudBlazor 9.0.0 under its MIT license, with class ownership now in Tuvima Library. See the full retained MIT notice in `licenses/MudBlazor-MIT.txt`.

## QRCoder (invitation QR codes)

QRCoder 1.6.0 draws the QR code that Users & Access shows with an invitation link. It runs inside the Dashboard, so the link never leaves the computer. Copyright Raffael Herrmann, MIT License.

## foliate-js (book and comic reader)

The in-browser book reader uses a pinned, unmodified copy of foliate-js (commit `78914aef`) under `src/MediaEngine.Web/wwwroot/lib/foliate-js/`, to open EPUB and comic (CBZ) files and keep standard reading positions. Copyright (c) 2022 John Factotum, MIT License (`src/MediaEngine.Web/wwwroot/lib/foliate-js/LICENSE`). It bundles zip.js (@zip.js/zip.js), copyright (c) 2022 Gildas Lormeau, BSD 3-Clause License, retained in `licenses/zip.js-BSD-3-Clause.txt`. Project: <https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate-js>.

## SecLists common-password list (password rules)

Tuvima Library refuses known common passwords when an account password is set or changed. The list is the NCSC "100k most used passwords" file from SecLists (`Passwords/Common-Credentials/100k-most-used-passwords-NCSC.txt`), filtered to entries of 12 or more characters, lower-cased and deduplicated into `src/MediaEngine.Identity/Resources/common-passwords.txt`. SecLists is distributed under the MIT License, copyright Daniel Miessler. The licence text is in `licenses/SecLists-MIT.txt`.
