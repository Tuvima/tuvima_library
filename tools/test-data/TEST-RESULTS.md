# End-to-End Ingestion Test Results

---

## Run: 2026-03-14 (post-fix round 2)

**Test suite:** 20 files (10 EPUB + 10 M4B) — full scenario coverage per SCENARIOS.md
**Engine version:** current `main` (post "Fix 3 ingestion bugs: duplicate detection, directory events, QID merge lock")

**Result summary:** 14 PASS · 0 FAIL · 6 PARTIAL

### Improvements vs Previous Run (2026-03-14 post-fix)

- PASS count: 11 → 14 (+3)
- FAIL count: 2 → 0 (both fixed)
- PARTIAL count: 4 → 6 (reclassified — scenario 8 and 10 now PASS, but scenario 11 demoted to PARTIAL)
- PersonMerged events: 7 → 4 (expected behavior, not a bug)
- Directory lock probes: 3 → 0 (fixed)
- Duplicate handling: race condition → correctly detected and deleted

### Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

#### Issue #D — Q0 QIDs for some M4B audiobooks (Medium)
**Affected:** HP PS/CoS (#17-18), Wool (#13), Wasp Factory (#16), Dune audio (#11)
**Root cause:** Stage 1 Wikidata SPARQL disambiguation fails for these titles — likely ambiguous results (Harry Potter has many Wikidata items). M4B files lack ISBN bridge IDs that EPUBs have, forcing title-only Wikidata search.
**Impact:** Files are organized but without QID, preventing cross-format Hub joining and deep enrichment.

#### Issue #G — Filename-only files not orphaned (Low)
**Affected:** echoes-filename-only.m4b (#15), phantom-signal (#8)
**Root cause:** Files score above the orphanage threshold (0.40) despite having minimal metadata. Stage 3 retail providers contribute enough claims to push confidence above the gate.
**Impact:** Files are organized to generic folders instead of being routed to `.orphans/` for manual review.

**Result summary:** 11 PASS · 2 FAIL · 4 PARTIAL (vs 9 PASS · 5 FAIL · 4 PARTIAL in 2026-03-15 run)

### Improvements vs 2026-03-15

- ✅ #A Stage 1 Wikidata guard: both `phantom-signal` and `echoes-filename-only` now have Stage 1 blocked
- ✅ #B MANIFEST.json no longer ingested
- ✅ Scenarios 19-20 (Expanse audio): now resolve QID Q6535598/Q5019811 (were Q0 last run)
- ✅ Leviathan Wakes audio cross-format Hub join working (same Q6535598 as EPUB)

### Remaining Issues

#### Issue #A (sub-issue) — Stage 3 retail false-positive path (High)
**What happened:** `phantom-signal-filename-only.epub` had Stage 1 correctly blocked ("no author, year, or bridge identifiers"). However, Stage 3 retail providers (Apple Books / Open Library / Google Books) ran a title search for "Unknown" (the OPF fallback title) and returned a match for Q24238356. The QID claim was written, scored, and the file was re-organized to `Unknown (Q24238356)`.
**Root cause:** The Stage 1 guard only prevents Wikidata direct searches. Stage 3 retail providers still run title-only searches which can return false matches for generic titles ("Unknown", "Untitled").
**Fix scope:** `HydrationPipelineService` — extend the title-only guard to Stage 3: when `hasMinimumIdentifiers` is false (same condition as the Stage 1 block), skip retail provider searches and route directly to the orphanage check after scoring. Or: add a post-pipeline confidence check that forces orphan routing when the only QID-granting claim came from a Stage 3 title search with no author/year validation.

#### Issue #C — Duplicate detection race condition (High — unresolved)
**What happened:** Same as 2026-03-15. `dune-duplicate.epub` processed first; `dune.epub` ended up as `Dune (2).epub`. Final state: `Dune (Q0)/Books/Dune (2).epub` (orphan artifact) + `Dune (Q190192)/Books/Dune.epub` (the duplicate that won).
**Status:** Not fixed. DB-level unique constraint on `content_hash` still needed.

#### Issue #D — Q0 QIDs for Harry Potter + Wool + Wasp Factory (Medium — partial improvement)
**Progress:** Caliban's War and Leviathan Wakes audio now resolved. Harry Potter PS/CoS, Wool, and Wasp Factory still return Q0.
**Hypothesis:** HP titles may be failing Wikidata SPARQL due to disambiguation (many matching items). Wool/Wasp Factory may be timing out or returning ambiguous results.
**Next step:** Test Stage 1 directly against Wikidata SPARQL endpoint for these specific titles; check disambiguation candidates in the review queue.

#### Issue #E — Double-hashing (Performance — unresolved)
**New variant:** "Ingestion skipped (lock probe failed)" for directories `expanse-audio/`, `hp-series/`, and `books/` — the startup batch scanner is treating these subdirectories as candidate file paths and attempting a lock probe.

#### Issue #F — PersonMerged race (Low — not fixed)
**Status:** 6 merge events still occurring for Q6142591 (James S.A. Corey) + 1 for Q34660 (Rowling). The commit claimed to fix this but the race persists. Per-name lock may not be in the right code path, or the Corey case involves more concurrent threads than the lock covers.

### Confirmed Fixes (vs 2026-03-14 run)

| # | Previous Issue | Status |
|---|---------------|--------|
| #4 | Narrator Person records not created | ✅ FIXED — Stephen Fry, Jim Dale, Jefferson Mays, Scott Brick, Stefan Rudnicki, Peter Kenny all created |
| #5 | Corrupt EPUB not quarantined | ✅ FIXED — corrupt-epub.epub moved to `.orphans/low-confidence/` |
| #1 | MANIFEST.json in watch folder | ✅ PARTIAL — generator now writes to parent dir, but Engine still picks it up (see Issue #B) |

### Issues Found

#### Issue #A — Filename-only EPUB false-positive Wikidata match (High)
**What happened:** `phantom-signal-filename-only.epub` (no OPF metadata) was organized as `Unknown (Q24238356)` with 100% confidence. The Engine used the filename stem `phantom-signal-filename-only` as the title, Wikidata title search returned Q24238356, the QID claim scored 1.0 and dominated the overall confidence.
**Root cause:** Filename-derived title claims should not be fed to Wikidata title search without a minimum pre-search confidence threshold. A file with no author, no year, and no cover should be treated as unidentified before any external lookup is attempted.
**Fix scope:** `HydrationPipelineService` — add a pre-search confidence gate: if the only available claim is a filename-derived title with no author and no year, skip Stage 1 (Wikidata) entirely and route to the orphanage check.

#### Issue #B — MANIFEST.json still being picked up by Engine (Medium)
**What happened:** `MANIFEST.json` written by generator to `C:\temp\tuvima-watch\MANIFEST.json` (outside the `books/` watch path) was ingested by the Engine, matched Wikidata Q53406553 (the TV show "Manifest"), and a Hub was created. The file was then correctly quarantined to `.orphans/low-confidence/MANIFEST.json`.
**Root cause:** Unknown. Generator correctly writes to parent directory (`Directory.GetParent(outputDir)`). Watch path in `config/libraries.json` is `C:\temp\tuvima-watch\books`. Investigate whether the `IngestionWatchService` batch-scan uses a parent-directory traversal or whether the startup scan uses a different path.
**Investigation:** Check `IngestionWatchService.StartBatchScanAsync` — verify it uses `LibraryFolder.SourcePath` exactly, not its parent. Also check if the FileSystemWatcher is initialized with the parent directory.
**Workaround:** Add a filename filter to the ingestion scanner to reject `.json` files.

#### Issue #C — Duplicate detection race condition (High — regression)
**What happened:** `dune-duplicate.epub` (byte-identical to `dune.epub`) was processed before `dune.epub` in the batch scan. Since no duplicate was in the DB yet, it passed the hash check and was organized to `Dune (Q0)/Books/Dune (2).epub`. The `DuplicateSkipped` event fires for the wrong file — it detects `dune.epub` as a duplicate of the already-processed `dune-duplicate.epub`.
**Chronology (all at 01:10:35):**
1. `dune-duplicate.epub` → EntityChainCreated, FileIngested, HydrationEnqueued, PathUpdated (organized)
2. `DuplicateSkipped: dune-duplicate.epub` → fires from concurrent thread (too late)
3. `DuplicateSkipped: dune.epub` → fires later at 01:11:04 (correct detection, wrong file)
**Root cause:** TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) race condition. The hash check and the DB insert are not atomic. Two files with identical hashes can both pass the check before either is stored.
**Fix scope:** Add a DB-level unique constraint on `media_assets.content_hash` (or an in-memory lock per hash in `IngestionEngine.ProcessCandidateAsync`). When the second file hits the constraint, route to `DuplicateSkipped` and abort the pipeline. This must happen BEFORE `EntityChainCreated` — the abort must be early in the pipeline.

#### Issue #D — Q0 QIDs + empty canonical-values in sidecar (Medium)
**What happened:** Several well-known titles got organized with Q0 and empty `<canonical-values />` in their sidecar: Wool, The Wasp Factory, Harry Potter PS, Leviathan Wakes audio, Caliban's War.
**Root cause (theory 1 — sidecar written too early):** The sidecar is written when the file is first organized (pre-hydration). After hydration completes, `PathUpdated: Re-organized after hydration` fires (visible in Dune's event log), but the Q0 files do not show this event. The Q0 files appear to be organized at batch scan time (01:11:04), before Wikidata/Wikipedia/retail providers responded.
**Root cause (theory 2 — Stage 1 failure):** These titles' Stage 1 (Wikidata) failed to resolve a QID. Without a QID, the sidecar has no wikidata_qid, and canonical values from Stage 2 (Wikipedia, requires QID) and Stage 3 (retail, uses bridge IDs from Stage 1) are absent.
**Evidence:** 7 pending review items include `AuthorityMatchFailed` entries — consistent with Stage 1 failures for these titles.
**Fix scope:** Investigate why well-known titles (Wool, Harry Potter PS) fail Stage 1. Check if Wikidata title search is timing out or returning too many ambiguous candidates.

#### Issue #E — Double-hashing (Performance)
**What happened:** 9 out of 20 files were hashed twice (30 total `FileHashed` events for 20 files). Files double-hashed: corrupt-epub.epub, dune-audiobook.m4b, enders-game.m4b, hitchhikers-guide.m4b, leviathan-wakes.epub, neuromancer.epub, phantom-signal-filename-only.epub, the-name-of-the-wind.epub, wool-omnibus.m4b.
**Root cause:** On Engine startup, the batch scan detects all existing files in the watch folder and hashes them. Simultaneously, the FileSystemWatcher fires `Created` events for the same files (since they're new since last startup). Both code paths converge on `ProcessCandidateAsync`, resulting in each file being hashed twice.
**Impact:** Low for 20 files. At 10,000-file scale, this doubles hash computation time and adds unnecessary DB writes.
**Fix scope:** `IngestionWatchService` — after the startup batch scan completes, begin accepting FileSystemWatcher events. Or: deduplicate incoming candidate paths in the ingestion queue using a ConcurrentHashSet.

#### Issue #F — PersonMerged firing multiple times for same entity (Low)
**What happened:** 6 `PersonMerged` events for James S.A. Corey variants (`"James S. A. Corey"` with spaces → canonical). Multiple concurrent ingestion threads detected the same person-name variant and each attempted a merge.
**Root cause:** `RecursiveIdentityService.EnrichAsync` runs concurrently for multiple files. When two files both reference "James S.A. Corey" (Leviathan Wakes EPUB and the Expanse audio files), two threads may both detect the variant name and enqueue separate merge operations.
**Impact:** Low — the merges are idempotent. The final state is correct (one canonical record).
**Fix scope:** Add a per-person-name lock in `RecursiveIdentityService` to prevent concurrent merge attempts for the same name.

### Issues Found

#### Issue #1 — MANIFEST.json picked up by Engine (Minor)
**What happened:** The generator writes `MANIFEST.json` into the watch folder root. The Engine picked it up as a candidate media file.
**Root cause:** Output path for MANIFEST.json is `{outputDir}/MANIFEST.json` which is inside the watch directory.
**Fix:** Move MANIFEST.json output to the parent directory: `{outputDir}/../MANIFEST.json` (i.e., `C:\temp\tuvima-watch\MANIFEST.json`).
**File:** `tools/GenerateTestEpubs/Program.cs` — manifest write path.

#### Issue #2 — Duplicate detection creates variant instead of skipping (High)
**What happened:** `dune-duplicate.epub` (byte-identical to `dune.epub`) was organized as a new asset with a `(2)` variant filename instead of triggering `DuplicateSkipped`.
**Root cause:** Hash-based duplicate detection is not active during the initial batch scan (only during live watch events). Batch scan processes all files in sequence without checking the hash store.
**Investigation:** Check `IngestionEngine.ProcessBatchAsync` vs `ProcessCandidateAsync` — the hash lookup likely runs in the candidate path but the batch path may skip it.
**Expected fix:** Hash check must run in both batch and watch paths before any processing proceeds.

#### Issue #3 — No-metadata files not orphaned (High)
**What happened:** `phantom-signal-filename-only.epub` (no OPF fields) and `echoes-filename-only.m4b` (no ID3 tags) were auto-organized instead of being moved to `.orphans/`.
**Root cause:** The scoring engine normalizes weights — when only one claim exists (the filename), it wins with weight 1.0 normalized to confidence 1.0. The orphanage gate `< 0.40` never fires.
**Investigation:** Check `ScoringEngine.NormalizeWeights` — normalization should not apply when the only claims have zero semantic value (empty title, no author, no year). A secondary gate is needed: if the single winning claim came from a filename-only source with confidence ≤ 0.25 before normalization, apply orphanage logic.
**Workaround:** A separate `FilenameOnlyOrphanageCheck` pass after scoring could detect files where `CanonicalTitle == filename_stem && AuthorCanonical == null`.

#### Issue #4 — Narrator Person records not created (High)
**What happened:** M4B files with narrator tags (e.g., `hitchhikers-guide.m4b` — Stephen Fry; `wool-omnibus.m4b` — Amanda Donahoe and Tim Gerard Reynolds) produced no narrator Person records.
**Root cause:** `RecursiveIdentityService.EnrichAsync` creates Person records for `Author` role only. The narrator field extracted by the audio processor is not being passed through to identity enrichment.
**Investigation:** Check `IngestionEngine.ProcessCandidateAsync` → look for where author PersonRef is created. The same pattern needs to apply for `narrator` canonical value → create `PersonRef` with `role = "Narrator"` → pass to `RecursiveIdentityService`.
**Fix scope:** `IngestionEngine` + `RecursiveIdentityService` — add narrator handling branch.

#### Issue #5 — Corrupt EPUB not quarantined (Medium)
**What happened:** `corrupt-epub.epub` (512 random bytes, not a ZIP) was ingested as media type "Other" and organized into the library instead of being flagged `IsCorrupt = true` with a `MediaFailed` activity.
**Root cause:** The EPUB processor likely throws on open, falls through to a generic handler, and the error is caught silently. The `IsCorrupt` path is not wired.
**Investigation:** Check `EpubProcessor.ProcessAsync` exception handling — a `ZipException` or `InvalidDataException` on open should set `ProcessorResult.IsCorrupt = true`. Ingestion pipeline should then route to quarantine instead of organizing.

#### Issue #6 — Ingestion hinting not verifiable in batch scan (Low)
**What happened:** Scenarios 17–20 (HP series and Expanse Audio subdirectories) ran correctly, but there's no log evidence that `FolderHint` was primed after file 17 and consumed by file 18.
**Root cause:** `IngestionHintCache` primes hints during live watch events where file arrival is sequential. During a batch scan, all files are queued simultaneously and the hint may not be available when sibling files are processed.
**Note:** This is a test infrastructure issue — hinting works correctly during live watch. For a definitive test, drop the two HP files into the watch folder with a 5-second gap between them.

### What Worked Well

- ✅ Core ingestion pipeline: all 20 files processed without crashes
- ✅ Cross-format Hub linking (Dune EPUB + M4B → same Hub)
- ✅ Provider cover art fill-in (Neuromancer, Ender's Game, etc.)
- ✅ Series + series_pos metadata (Name of the Wind, Ender's Game)
- ✅ Author name conflict detection (Foundation — Asimov, Isaac)
- ✅ Wikidata Stage 1 QID resolution for well-known titles
- ✅ Wikipedia Stage 2 description enrichment
- ✅ Hero banner generation for all files with cover art
- ✅ Organization template applied correctly (`{Category}/{Title} ({Qid})/{Format}/`)
- ✅ Activity ledger: ~400 entries, full audit trail visible

### Prioritized Next Actions

## Run: 2026-03-10

**Test suite:** 10 EPUBs + 10 M4B audiobooks (20 files total)
**Engine version:** current `main`
**Database:** fresh wipe before run

### Summary

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Files generated | 20 (10 EPUB + 10 M4B) |
| Files ingested | 20 / 20 |
| Organized into library | 20 / 20 |
| Hero banners generated | 17 |
| Cover images (on disk) | 17 |
| Author headshots (Wikidata) | 14 / 17 persons |
| Hubs created | 17 |
| Review queue (Pending) | 2 |
| Activity log entries | 220 |

### Key Scenario Outcomes

**✅ Cross-Format Hub Linking (Dune)** — Both `dune.epub` and `dune-audiobook.m4b` correctly assigned to the same Hub.

**✅ Provider Cover Fill-In** — Neuromancer, Words of Radiance, Ender's Game all received cover.jpg from Apple Books / Audnexus.

**✅ Author Name Conflict** — `foundation.epub` tagged `"Asimov, Isaac"` (reversed). Two Person records created: `Asimov, Isaac` (no headshot) and `Isaac Asimov` (Wikidata headshot). Correct behaviour.

**✅ Wikidata Person Enrichment** — 14/17 persons enriched with headshots.

**✅ Review Queue — Fictional Content** — 2 items: `Echoes of the Void` and `echoes-filename-only`.

**✅ Hero Banners** — 17 hero banners generated for all files with cover art.

**✅ Activity Log** — 220 entries covering full ingestion chain per file.

### Issues Found (2026-03-10)

**Minor — Tolkien name spacing:** Two person folders for `J.R.R. Tolkien` vs `J. R. R. Tolkien` (EPUB tag vs Wikidata canonical label).

**Minor — phantom-signal Unknown/Unknown:** Filename-only EPUB organized to `Unknown/Unknown/Unknown.epub` with a cover — likely a false provider match on empty query.

**Minor — The Last Archive organized despite fictional:** Fictional title/author auto-organized because local confidence from ID3 tags ≥ 0.85. Correct per confidence gate; noteworthy.
