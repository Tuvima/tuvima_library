# Antigravity ↔ Claude Code — Sync Map

> **Last synced:** 2026-03-05
>
> **Canonical source of truth:** `CLAUDE.md` (repo root)
>
> This file tells Antigravity (Gemini) how its `.agent/` files relate to `CLAUDE.md`, the project memory used by Claude Code.

## Rules

1. **`CLAUDE.md` is authoritative.** If information conflicts between `CLAUDE.md` and an `.agent/` file, `CLAUDE.md` wins.
2. **After changing any `.agent/` file**, update the corresponding `CLAUDE.md` section listed below.
3. **After changing `CLAUDE.md`**, update the corresponding `.agent/` file(s) listed below.
4. **Update the "Last synced" date** at the top of this file whenever a sync is performed.

## What to do after making changes

### If you modified a feature or skill file:
1. Open `CLAUDE.md` and find the matching section from the table above.
2. Update that section to reflect the new information.
3. Update the "Last synced" date at the top of this file.

### If you created a new feature or skill file:
1. Add a row to the mapping table above.
2. Add a matching section to `CLAUDE.md` (typically in §3).
3. Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` §5.3 has the reverse mapping — add the new file there too.

### If `CLAUDE.md` was updated by Claude Code:
1. Check `CLAUDE.md` §5.3 for the sync mapping table.
2. Update the corresponding `.agent/` files from the table above.
3. Update the "Last synced" date at the top of this file.
