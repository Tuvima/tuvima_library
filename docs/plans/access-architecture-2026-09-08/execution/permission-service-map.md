# P00 permission-to-service map

Status: source-derived inventory at tentative SHA `1b75af4e76ad4b4afc9ce23769877566f6ec10e2`. `Existing` means a backing route/service exists, not that it already enforces this permission correctly. `Unavailable` is the required P01 registry state until the named packet supplies a tested service. The registry must preserve every ID below.

| Permission ID | P01 state | Existing service/route | Enforcement owner or unavailable reason |

## Native compatibility constraint

The ten existing IDs in `ClientApiScopes` are `library.read`, `artwork.read`, `progress.read`, `progress.write`, `queue.read`, `queue.write`, `playback.read`, `playback.write`, `downloads.read`, and `downloads.write`. P01 must source them from the registry without changing device authorization/token JSON. P02 binds live tokens to Application + Account + approved Profile; P03 evaluates the delegated human intersection on every resource.

## Plugin host capabilities

`media.read`, `network.http`, `process.execute`, `tool.download`, `ai.infer`, and proposed `storage.plugin` are host capabilities, not Application catalogue grants. P08 owns `IPluginPermissionGate` and host-bound execution context. Plugin application permissions use a collision-checked `plugin.{plugin-id}.{service}.{action}` namespace and remain unavailable when the plugin/service is disabled (P09).

## Credential boundary

Inbound Tuvima identities are current `X-Api-Key`, Dashboard `X-Tuvima-Service-Key`, browser session `X-Tuvima-Session`, native Bearer access/refresh tokens, signed `X-Tuvima-View-*` assertions, and short-lived Intercom Bearer tokens. Outbound provider credentials live behind `ProviderCredentialService`/provider configuration and must not be migrated into Applications. Docker/config bootstrap and native test scripts must be re-audited at P02/P13 without recording secret values.
