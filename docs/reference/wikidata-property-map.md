# Wikidata Property Map

This table describes properties actually requested by `config/providers/wikidata_reconciliation.json`. Entity-valued properties retain both a localized display label and a QID in `canonical_value_arrays`; Smart Collection rules persist the QID as identity.

## Structured Discovery Properties

| P-code | Claim key | Cardinality | Typical scope |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| P166 | `award_received` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P1411 | `award_nominated` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P495 | `country_of_origin` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P407 | `language` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P364 | `original_language` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P272 | `production_company` | Many | Movie or TV root Work |
| P449 | `network` | Many | TV root Work |
| P123 | `publisher` | Many | Literary Work; audiobook Edition |
| P264 | `record_label` | Many | Album/root Work |
| P2408 | `set_in_period` | Many | Work/root Work |
| P915 | `filming_location` | Many | Movie or TV root Work |

Award and nomination categories are also extended with P361 in one batched, cached request. A declared parent becomes `award_family` or `nomination_family`; no family is guessed when Wikidata has no reliable parent.

### Knowledge state and refresh

`enrichment.structured_discovery_metadata` version `1.0` records a state per field. A successful lookup with no statement is `no_result` (unknown), not false. Smart Collections expose `is known`, `is unknown`, and `has any value`; `is not` requires a known value. The enrichment schedule detects libraries without this capability version and queues a normal universe refresh, so existing items are backfilled without re-import. Later regular Stage 3 refreshes replace the current Wikidata observation set while retaining superseded claims as provenance history.

### Subjective AI attributes

Themes, mood, vibe, and content warnings remain local-AI attributes. They are deliberately not populated from Wikidata and can be combined with structured facts in the same collection rule set.

## Bridge Identifiers

Bridge identifiers are external IDs used to cross-reference Wikidata entities with retail and specialist providers. They enable precise QID resolution in Stage 2 of the hydration pipeline.

## Notes on Confidence Levels

Confidence values indicate the strength of trust assigned to a claim when it enters the Priority Cascade:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.9 | High confidence - Wikidata is the primary authority for this field |
| 0.85 | Good confidence - used for person-scope properties and identifiers |
| 0.8 | Moderate confidence - lore/narrative properties where Wikidata coverage varies |

For the `author` field specifically, a non-Wikidata claim with strictly higher confidence than the best Wikidata P50 claim wins in Tier C of the cascade (to honour deliberately reduced P50 author confidence of 0.75 and preserve embedded pen names at 0.95). All other fields follow standard Tier C Wikidata authority.

See [`docs/architecture/scoring-and-cascade.md`](../architecture/scoring-and-cascade.md) for the full Priority Cascade rules.
