# Attributions

Identify the major software, fonts, and knowledge sources used by Tuvima Library and its documentation. Dependency manifests and retained license notices provide the exact version and license records.

## Where this lives in the code

- `Directory.Packages.props`
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`
- `website/package-lock.json`
- `website/LICENSES.md`

Tuvima Library is built on open-source software, public knowledge projects, and optional metadata providers. This page is a practical acknowledgement list, not a substitute for each dependency's license file.

The authoritative package version list is `Directory.Packages.props`; the project license is AGPLv3.
