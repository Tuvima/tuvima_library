# Engine API Reference

Public client base URL: the Dashboard origin plus `/api/v1` (for local development, `http://localhost:5016/api/v1`).

The Engine origin (`http://localhost:61495` in development) is an internal service boundary. Native clients must discover and call the Dashboard origin and never receive the Dashboard service credential or connect to the Engine port.

Interactive documentation: `http://localhost:61495/swagger`

Administrative Engine endpoints require a first-party Dashboard session or an API key. Public v1 client endpoints use scoped bearer tokens issued to a paired device.

## Public client API v1

API v1 is the frozen native-client contract. Breaking request or response changes require a new major path. Additive fields may be introduced in v1; clients must ignore fields they do not understand.

### Discovery and pairing

1. `GET /.well-known/tuvima` on the Dashboard origin returns the public API base, supported versions, device-authorization and token endpoints, verification URL, and server capabilities.
2. A television or other input-constrained client posts form data or JSON to `POST /api/v1/oauth/device_authorization` with a stable public `client_id`, display names, version, device class, requested space-delimited scopes, and capabilities.
3. The user opens the returned `verification_uri` on an authenticated browser, reviews the exact client/device/scopes, and approves or denies it. Device codes expire after 10 minutes and polling starts at the returned interval.
4. The device polls `POST /api/v1/oauth/token` using grant type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`. `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`, `access_denied`, and `expired_token` are normal OAuth error responses.
5. Access tokens last 10 minutes. Refresh tokens rotate on every successful `refresh_token` grant and expire after 30 days. Reuse of a consumed refresh token revokes its token family.

Tokens are opaque bearer credentials and must be stored in the platform secure credential store. Device and token identifiers in request bodies or query strings are never authority; the Engine uses the profile, device class, client, and scopes bound to the bearer token. `GET /api/v1/devices` lists grants for the active profile, `GET /api/v1/devices/current` describes the caller, `PUT /api/v1/devices/current/capabilities` replaces negotiated capabilities, and `DELETE /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}` immediately revokes that device and all of its tokens.

### Scopes and resources

| Resource | Primary routes | Required scope |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | `GET /.well-known/tuvima` | None |
| Browse/home | `GET /api/v1/display/home`, `/browse`, `/shelves/{key}`, `/groups/{id}` | `library.read` |
| Search | `GET /api/v1/display/search?q=` | `library.read` |
| Details | `GET /api/v1/details/{entityType}/{id}` | `library.read` |
| Artwork/media bytes | URLs returned by display/detail/manifest models; `/api/v1/stream/{assetId}` supports ranges and signed `/api/v1/stream/hls/...` paths serve adaptive packages | `artwork.read` or `playback.read` as applicable |
| Progress | `GET/PUT /api/v1/progress/{assetId}`, `GET /recent`, `GET /journey` | `progress.read` / `progress.write` |
| Queues | `GET /api/v1/player/state`, mutations under `/api/v1/player/queue` | `queue.read` / `queue.write` |
| Playback session | `/api/v1/player/command`, `/heartbeat`, `/session/takeover` | `playback.write` or `progress.write` |
| Playback decision | `GET /api/v1/playback/{assetId}/manifest` | `playback.read` |
| Downloads | encode/offline routes under `/api/v1/playback` | `downloads.read` / `downloads.write` |

Capability negotiation declares containers, video/audio codecs, subtitle formats, protocols, maximum dimensions/bitrate/channels, HDR, speed, and offline-download support. The playback manifest compares those registered capabilities with inspected source media and returns `directPlaySupported`, `recommendedDelivery`, source/alternate URLs, tracks, chapters, resume state, warnings, and a conversion reason. For HLS it also returns `hlsStatus`, `hlsUrl`, and `hlsExpiresAt`. `preparing` means the client should retry the manifest; `ready` supplies the playable path. Clients must follow the manifest rather than independently guessing whether a file can direct-play.

The HLS URL is a bearer capability scoped to one asset, package, and expiration time. It is intentionally usable by native HLS media stacks that cannot attach application authorization headers to every segment request. Clients must not log, persist, or share it. Expired or modified paths return `403`; missing and traversal-rejected package resources return `404`. Relative URIs in the master and media playlists preserve the same signed path for variant, alternate-audio, caption, and segment requests.

Most paginated GET endpoints accept `offset`/`limit` query parameters. View
timeline and discovery endpoints use opaque/keyset `cursor` plus `limit`, and
Manual Gallery membership uses position/item keysets. Limits are clamped
server-side so a caller cannot force an unbounded read.

JSON errors use RFC 7807 Problem Details through the shared `ApiErrors`
factories. JSON success bodies use named `MediaEngine.Contracts` types, and
every production route declares its 2xx response metadata for Swagger. Untyped
success metadata is reserved for reviewed bodyless, redirect, file, stream, and
direct-response routes.

`MediaEngine.Contracts` is the sole owner of non-frozen HTTP and SignalR wire
types. Engine endpoints map internal projections explicitly into those
contracts, and the Dashboard may add presentation wrappers without redefining
the JSON payload. The only frozen exception is the exact Universe/Chronicle
SignalR pair `LoreDeltaDiscoveredEvent` and
`UniverseEnrichmentProgressEvent`; Universe HTTP responses are not exempt.

The canonical contracts intentionally include fields that existed on only one
side of the former API/Dashboard mirror boundary. Notable examples are
ingestion `count_unit`; person and person-backed collection `roles`; complete AI
settings plus resource `cpu_pressure`; complete managed-collection, placement,
rule, permission, and artwork fields; playback manifest, player, settings,
chapter, bookmark, text-track, and offline-delivery fields; and plugin
manifest, capability, permission, tool, AI-permission, health, job, and approved
catalog fields. These are contract completeness corrections, not separate
compatibility versions.

## System

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/system/status` | Service health, version, uptime | None |
| GET | `/system/activity-status` | Sanitized leased/running durable operations used to seed the Dashboard navbar activity indicator; excludes media titles and filesystem paths | Required |
| GET | `/system/watcher-status` | File watcher diagnostic - shows monitored folders and last event | Required |
| POST | `/maintenance/sweep-orphan-assets` | Scan `.data/assets/` for managed files with no database reference and remove them. | Administrator |
| POST | `/maintenance/storage/run` | Run storage maintenance on demand. Supports `dryRun`, cache retention, image retention, and claim compaction batch query parameters. | Administrator |

---

## Library

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/library/works` | All works with their canonical values | Required |

## Media Management

Library configuration uses schema `4.0`, including explicit server-visible folder-picker roots. Older flat-folder and Photos/General
schemas are rejected during the pre-beta cutover rather than migrated or served
through compatibility routes.

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settings/libraries` | Return the complete library configuration, including stable sources and universal incoming sources | Administrator |
| PUT | `/settings/libraries` | Validate and replace the complete schema-3 library configuration | Administrator |
| GET | `/settings/incoming-sources` | Return universal unassigned intake folders | Administrator |
| PUT | `/settings/incoming-sources` | Validate and replace universal incoming folders | Administrator |
| POST | `/settings/libraries/{libraryId}/reorganization/plan` | Produce a read-only, expiring move/rename plan with stable source IDs, conflicts, blocked work, and an exact confirmation fingerprint | Administrator |
| POST | `/settings/libraries/{libraryId}/reorganization/execute` | Execute one confirmed plan once, revalidating source policy, files, collisions, and free space immediately before each operation | Administrator |

Reorganization execution requires both the returned `plan_id` and its exact
`fingerprint`. A plan expires after 15 minutes and cannot be reused. Partial
outcomes are reported per item; an existing-library source is always blocked
from mutation.

## View

Personal View routes require the trusted profile assertion established by the
Dashboard. The server-to-server `X-Tuvima-View-Profile`,
`X-Tuvima-View-Timestamp`, and `X-Tuvima-View-Signature` headers bind the active
profile to the exact method/path/query through HMAC-SHA256 using the already
validated API key. They are accepted only for `/view` and `/collections`, must
be within the configured short skew window, and are not browser credentials.

Browser-supplied profile, library, Gallery, scope-profile, or asset IDs are
never treated as authority. Friendly Shared, Mine, and permitted Profile scopes
are resolved by the Engine before any asset, Gallery, People, Places,
thumbnail, original-file, or personal-media Collection query runs. Direct
unauthorized identifiers return the same not-found shape as missing resources.

---

## Ingestion

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/ingestion/scan` | Dry-run scan of configured library folders. Reports what would be ingested without making changes. | Administrator |
| POST | `/ingestion/library-scan` | Scan library folders and update known file paths. Triggers ingestion for new files. | Administrator |
| POST | `/ingestion/upload` | Upload a file to the explicit managed, writable primary destination identified by multipart `destinationLibraryId`; catalogued files retain stable intake IDs, while personal files are indexed directly into View without catalogue/provider work | Administrator |
| GET | `/ingestion/operations` | Dashboard snapshot backed by durable ingestion operation counts, numbered `stage_progress` rows, current activity, review state, provider health, and recent batch summaries. | Curator |
| GET | `/ingestion/batches` | Recent ingestion batches. | Curator |
| GET | `/ingestion/batches/{batchId}` | Single ingestion batch summary. | Curator |
| GET | `/ingestion/batches/{batchId}/items` | Durable per-file item ledger for a batch, sourced from `media_operations`. | Curator |
| GET | `/ingestion/watch-folder` | Returns the derived current watch folder view from configured library source folders. | Required |

`/ingestion/operations.stage_progress` contains numbered ingestion stage rows with `stage_number`, `stage_key`, `label`, `completed_files`, `total_files`, `count_unit`, `percent_complete`, `active_count`, `queued_count`, `status_label`, `active_item_label`, `active_group_label`, `active_group_count`, `label_accuracy`, `artifact_label`, `artifact_count`, `detail_items`, `last_updated_time`, and `is_stale`. `count_unit` identifies what the counts measure, such as files, albums, people, artwork assets, or links, so clients do not relabel grouped work as files. `detail_items` is an optional list of `{ label, value, tone?, icon? }` rows populated by the Engine so clients do not hardcode provider math. Grouped provider work, such as batched Wikidata resolution, uses group labels instead of fake exact file labels unless per-file correlation is available.

The Dashboard renders Stages 1-8 as compact progress rows. Review/attention state remains in the snapshot for API consumers, but the Dashboard surfaces it through the top **Need Review** metric and the `recent_batches` review count rather than as another progress bar. `recent_batches` rows include batch id, status, timing, file totals, media-type counts, registered/review/failed counts, and artifact totals such as people, artwork, metadata, matched, and review.
