# Approved Plugin Catalog

The Engine can read a GitHub-hosted JSON list of approved plugins through:

```http
GET /plugins/approved
```

The source URL is configured in `config/core.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin_catalog": {
    "enabled": true,
    "approved_plugins_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tuvima/tuvima_library/main/docs/reference/approved-plugins.json"
  }
}
```

The Engine only accepts HTTPS URLs hosted by `raw.githubusercontent.com` or `github.com`. The catalog is read-only. It does not install plugin code.

## Status values

Catalog-level status:

- `ok`: fetched and parsed successfully.
- `disabled`: disabled by local config.
- `invalid_source`: configured URL is not an allowed GitHub URL.
- `unavailable`: GitHub could not be reached or returned an error.

Plugin-level status:

- `approved`: current approved release.
- `deprecated`: still listed for existing users but not recommended for new installs.
- `blocked`: no longer approved; do not install.

Plain English summary: Tuvima reads a GitHub JSON file to show admins which plugins are approved. The list helps discovery and review, but installing the plugin is still a manual action.
