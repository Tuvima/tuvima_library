# Glossary

These are the terms used in Tuvima Library documentation. User-facing terms are preferred; internal code names appear only when they help connect the docs to the repository.

## A

**Artwork Outcome**  
Whether artwork is present, missing after an explicit artwork pass, or still pending.

## B

**Browse Readiness Gate**  
The rule that controls whether an item appears in Home, Read, Watch, Listen, Collections, or Search. The item needs a non-placeholder title, a resolved media type, and a settled artwork outcome.

## C

**Canonical Value**  
The winning metadata value for a field after the Priority Cascade resolves competing claims.

**Claim**  
A single metadata value from a specific source with confidence and provenance. Claims are append-only so earlier source data can be audited later.

**Collection**  
A broader rollup or user-managed grouping shown on the Collections surface. A Collection should not duplicate a single lane-level shelf. For example, a book series belongs in Read; a wider world that connects novels and films can appear in Collections.

## D

**Dashboard**  
The Blazor Server web UI (`MediaEngine.Web`) used to browse, search, read, play, configure, and review the library.

**Detail Page**  
The page for a work, collection, book, movie, TV show, episode, person, or other supported entity. Detail pages are the normal place to inspect an item and launch inline corrections.

## E

**Edition**  
A specific release or format of a work, such as one ebook edition, one audiobook release, or one film cut.

**Engine**  
The backend application (`MediaEngine.Api`) that runs ingestion, enrichment, storage, background jobs, Local AI, and the API used by the Dashboard.

**Enrichment**  
Follow-up metadata work after basic identity is known, such as artwork, people, relationships, descriptions, summaries, and universe graph data.

## H

**Hydration**  
The identity enrichment process after ingestion. Retail providers gather practical matches and bridge IDs; Wikidata resolution uses those IDs to find canonical identity when possible.

## L

**Library Folder**  
A configured source folder that tells the Engine where to scan, what media types to expect, and how files should be handled.

**Local AI**  
AI features that run on local model files through local runtimes. Local AI helps with classification, matching, summaries, vibe tags, intent parsing, and audio tasks, but it does not become the authority for factual metadata.

## M

**Media Asset**  
A single file on disk, such as one `.epub`, `.mkv`, `.m4b`, `.flac`, or `.cbz`.

**Media Lane**  
One of the main browse surfaces: Read, Watch, or Listen.

**Media Type**  
The resolved category for a file: Books, Audiobooks, Movies, TV, Music, or Comics.

## P

**Priority Cascade**  
The rules that decide which metadata source wins. User locks win first, configured field priorities come next, Wikidata is the default authority for canonical structured facts, and highest confidence wins only after those earlier rules are considered.

**Processor**  
Code that opens a file format and extracts embedded metadata, artwork, and technical facts.

**Provider**  
An external metadata source such as Apple, TMDB, MusicBrainz, Comic Vine, Open Library, Fanart.tv, or Wikidata.

## Q

**QID**  
A Wikidata entity identifier such as `Q190804`. A QID is a strong identity anchor, but an item can still be usable without one if it passes the browse readiness gate.

**QID Not Found**  
A controlled outcome where Retail matching succeeded but Wikidata could not resolve a trustworthy QID. The item keeps its available metadata and may still be visible if it is otherwise ready.

## R

**Readiness Label**  
A plain-English status summary such as Ready, Pending artwork, Needs review, or Engine unavailable.

**Retail Stage**  
The provider stage that searches external catalogues for practical metadata such as covers, descriptions, ratings, and bridge IDs.

**Review Queue**  
The exception workflow for blocked, uncertain, low-confidence, or unresolved items that need human confirmation.

## S

**Series**  
A lane-level shelf, such as a book series in Read, a film series in Watch, or an album/audio series in Listen. Comics use volume/issue wording on user-facing surfaces even when the stored metadata field is still `series`.

**Shelf**  
An immediate browse group inside a media lane. A single shelf does not automatically create a Collections tile.

**Staging**  
The safe on-disk and database holding state between file discovery and final organization. Staging is not the same as browse visibility.

## U

**Universe**  
A larger world or franchise that can connect multiple shelves. Tuvima uses universe-style relationships to decide when a broader Collection is useful.

## W

**Wikidata**  
The canonical identity and structured-fact authority used after provider bridge IDs make resolution precise enough.

**Work**  
The underlying title independent of file, edition, or format.

**Writeback**  
Writing resolved metadata back into supported file tags after enrichment or user correction.

## Retired Terms

**Removed all-in-one workspace**  
Old management concepts that should not be reintroduced. Current browse and correction flows use Home, Read, Watch, Listen, Collections, Search, detail pages, Review Queue, and Settings/Admin.
