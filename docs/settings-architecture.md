# Settings Architecture

Tuvima Library uses one rule for settings ownership: runtime configuration lives in JSON, while operational/user state lives in SQLite.

## JSON-Owned Configuration

Use JSON for settings that affect startup, background workers, provider behavior, library organization, or runtime policy:

- `config/core.json`: server identity, paths, organization templates, auth, storage policy.
- `config/libraries.json`: source libraries and watched roots.
- `config/providers/*.json` and `config/secrets/*.json`: provider capabilities, endpoints, credentials, weights, and limits.
- `config/ai.json`: model files, AI feature flags, schedules, vocabulary, hardware profile.
- `config/transcoding.json`: playback encoding, offline variants, cache retention.
- `config/hydration.json`, `config/pipelines.json`, `config/scoring.json`, `config/field_priorities.json`, `config/media_types.json`: metadata decision policy.
- `config/maintenance.json` and `config/writeback*.json`: cleanup and file write-back policy.

## SQLite-Owned State

Use SQLite for records created or changed by product workflows:

- profiles, profile external logins, and API keys.
- provider health and recent failures.
- review queue entries and resolution history.
- ingestion batches, ingestion logs, identity jobs, and Library Operations status inputs.
- system activity, encode jobs, and playback/reading progress.

## Library Operations

The Settings/Admin ingestion route is now the **Library Operations** page. It is a read-heavy operational dashboard, not a configuration editor and not a raw background-job log. Its Engine snapshot (`GET /ingestion/operations`) combines JSON-owned configuration with SQLite-owned state:

- JSON supplies configured source folders, provider definitions, and organization templates.
- SQLite supplies lifecycle counts, active/recent ingestion batches, review reasons, provider health records, and pipeline progress.
- SignalR supplies live `BatchProgress` and `IngestionProgress` updates between snapshot refreshes.

When a backing signal does not exist yet, the UI should show an unavailable or not-tracked state instead of static sample data.

## Settings Status Labels

Settings/Admin uses explicit status labels so admins can tell whether a control changes the Engine or is only informational:

- **Live** means the visible setting loads from the Engine and saves through an Engine endpoint or typed Dashboard client.
- **Partial** means part of the section is live, while other controls are read-only, planned, or dependent on Engine data.
- **Planned** means the product surface is intentionally visible, but it does not save or affect runtime behavior yet.
- **Experimental** means the capability is real enough to test but not guaranteed as stable product behavior.
- **Not connected** means a control has no persistence path and must be disabled.
- **Engine unavailable** means the Dashboard could not load Engine state and must not substitute fake defaults.
- **Read-only** means the setting is loaded from config/state but cannot be changed at runtime from the Dashboard.
- **Requires restart**, **Requires provider credentials**, and **Requires admin role** describe specific blockers before a setting can take effect.

Folders, provider configuration, provider priority, transcoding policy, profile management, API keys, activity retention, plugin enablement, and dynamic plugin settings should use typed Engine API/orchestrator paths. Metadata, Local AI, Delivery, Access, and Plugin subsections that are not fully backed must remain disabled or explicitly marked partial/not connected.

Folder saves update `config/core.json`; the Engine attempts to hot-swap the watcher when the watch folder exists and is accessible. A rescan is still recommended after folder changes because files already present in a new watch folder may need to be reprocessed.

Provider settings load from `config/providers/*.json`, `config/secrets/*.json`, provider health records, and `config/pipelines.json`. Credentials are never returned in plaintext; the UI can show only whether a required credential is present. Provider strategy meanings are:

- **Waterfall**: first confident match wins.
- **Cascade**: providers run and claims are merged.
- **Sequential**: one provider feeds identifiers into the next.

Access/API key management is SQLite-backed. New API keys show plaintext only once on creation, list views expose labels and creation dates, and revoke actions remove individual or all keys without returning secrets.

## Deprecated Public Settings

Palette, accent, and color customization are no longer product-facing settings. Any remaining palette files or accent fields are treated as internal design tokens used by theming services, not as user/admin options.

## UI Rule

Every visible settings page should declare its source of truth, editability, role requirement, validation shape, and whether a restart is required. Placeholder or local-only controls should stay hidden until backed by a real persistence path.
