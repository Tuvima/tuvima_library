# Product Status

Tuvima Library is in **Early Access**. The core architecture is real, the Engine and Dashboard run locally, and many workflows are usable today. Some areas are still partial, intentionally read-only, or planned for later phases. This page keeps that distinction clear.

For the row-by-row implementation truth table, see the [Feature Truth Inventory](feature-truth-inventory.md).

## Built Today

| Area | Status | What this means |
|---|---|---|
| Engine and Dashboard | Live | The API host and Blazor Dashboard run locally and communicate over HTTP and SignalR. |
| Home, Read, Watch, Listen | Partial | Browse surfaces render real Engine display data when available. Quality depends on ingested library data. |
| Collections | Partial | Broader rollups, playlists, and managed collections exist where backed by Engine data. Lane-level shelves stay in their media lanes. |
| Search | Partial | Cross-library search is wired to Engine display/search APIs. Results depend on indexed metadata. |
| Detail pages | Live | Item detail surfaces show metadata and launch inline editing through the shared editor. |
| Review Queue | Live | Uncertain or blocked items can be reviewed, dismissed, skipped for universe/QID, or resolved through Engine-backed actions. |
| Durable operations | Live | Ingestion, Wikidata bridge work, and plugin jobs have restart-safe operation rows with status, stage, progress, retry, and failure detail. |
| Capability readiness | Partial | Media assets can expose explicit readiness rows for identity, enrichment, text tracks, commercial skip, writeback, AI, and plugin work. More workers will be wired over time. |
| Ingestion dashboard | Partial | Active operations, recent batches, folder health, provider health, progress, and review reasons are visible from durable Engine data where available. |
| Settings > Media Management | Live | Catalogued and personal libraries, stable sources, incoming locations, source safety, organization, metadata, ownership, visibility, intake, and duplicate policies are backed by Engine/config APIs. |
| View Personal Spaces | Live | Each enabled profile resolves one Personal Space. One configured `personal` library and any number of sources or devices may feed it; eligible folders are watched and reconciled in the background. Administrators can review safe source/device summaries without seeing paths, secrets, or client identifiers. Local-only/manual personal media bypasses retail providers, Wikidata, canonical claims, and Review Queue. |
| View: Photos | Live | `/view` uses the four-item View shell and same-origin media grants. Trusted Shared, Mine, and permitted profile scopes drive a cursor-paged mixed-media timeline with search, filters, uploads, selection, favorites, hidden state, archive, trash, restore, Gallery placement, managed thumbnails, and an accessible immersive viewer. Original files are never modified by browsing or thumbnail generation. |
| View: Galleries | Live | Manual and rule-driven Smart Galleries support creation, editing, deletion, item paging, duplicate-safe membership, drag/drop placement, ordering, and owner-selected profile sharing. Policy-gated recipients receive view or contribute access; deleting a Gallery never deletes media. Public-link sharing is not implemented. |
| View: People and Places | Partial | People browses only named or reviewed provenance-aware annotations and shows a truthful capability state when no producer exists. Places renders real GPS/place aggregates in a privacy-safe local cluster surface and accessible place cards. Face recognition and third-party map tiles are not implemented. |
| View in Collections | Live | Administrators can attach a whole Gallery or a versioned View smart rule in the Collection editor. Individual local asset IDs are rejected, saved sources remain dynamic, and every projection reapplies View authorization without leaking unauthorized counts. |
| Backup and recovery | Live | Administrators can create, list, download, validate, stage, and apply backups containing the data store and non-secret configuration. |
| Settings > Providers | Live | Provider catalogue/status/config, credential state, health, tests, and pipeline priority are backed where the Engine exposes them. |
| Settings > Local AI | Live | Model inventory, download/cancel/load/unload, hardware profile, benchmark, resources, feature flags, vocabulary, and schedules are connected where endpoints exist. |
| Playback and reader preferences | Live | Personal playback, reading, subtitle, resume, audiobook chapter cleanup, audiobook history/bookmarks, chapter display-title overrides, and progress preferences persist through the playback settings and player APIs. |
| Plugins | Partial | Plugin list, enable/disable, settings JSON, dynamic manifests, health, jobs, and approved-catalog lookup are available. |
| Users and access | Partial | Profiles and API keys are Engine-backed. Remote access and some network controls are still read-only or not connected. |

## Still Outstanding

These items are not presented as complete user workflows yet:

- A guided multi-step first-run wizard. Current onboarding starts on Home and continues through Libraries and Ingestion.
- Advanced direct-play, delivery, subtitle/audio policy, and automated offline-download controls.
- Plugin marketplace install/update flows.
- Some Local AI job controls, deletion actions, and per-feature runtime integrations.
- Full worker coverage for every capability row. The durable model exists; individual enrichment, AI, text track, and writeback workers will continue moving from artifact-only writes to operation/capability updates.
- Richer playlist editing, recommendation automation, smart collections, and broader discovery intelligence.
- Full remote-access hardening and account/session policy beyond the local-first role/API-key model.
- Interoperability targets such as OPDS, Audiobookshelf-compatible APIs, import wizards, webhooks, and PWA behavior.
- Post-beta photo intelligence: face recognition, object/scene detection, OCR,
  captions, embeddings, semantic search, memories, and AI-assisted organization.
- Privacy-safe map rendering, remote/public-link sharing, and mobile
  upload/backup/sync. GPS-based place aggregation exists, but these client and
  presentation experiences are not implemented.
- Device-specific mobile-backup and connected-device producers. Source/device
  records and intake policy vocabulary exist so future clients have a safe
  target, but they are not working backup products today.
- Automatic shared-incoming routing into a profile's Personal Space. Mixed
  local candidates are classified and left for attention today; explicit
  browser uploads already resolve the caller's Personal Space and bypass
  catalogue processing.

## Product Guardrails

- Normal media corrections happen inline from the page, card, row, album, track, movie, show, book, comic, or detail view where the issue appears.
- Review Queue is only for terminal or actionable issues that need human/admin confirmation. In-progress uncertainty belongs in Operations, Capabilities, retry backlog, or blocked work views.
- Settings/Admin is for configuration and operational state.
- The retired all-in-one correction workspace must not return as a current product surface.
- Future-state documents must say they are future-state documents.
