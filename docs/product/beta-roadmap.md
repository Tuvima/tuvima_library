# Beta Roadmap and Priority Order

This roadmap orders work by dependency and risk, not by visual novelty. A beta must first protect a person's library, tell the truth about incomplete capabilities, and keep local-only content out of online matching. Features higher in the hierarchy unblock or de-risk the work beneath them.

## P0 — Beta Safety and Architectural Boundaries

### 1. Reproducible installation and startup — implemented

- Restore from public package sources without a developer-specific local feed.
- Seed container configuration only when the mounted configuration folder is empty.
- Use portable container paths for catalogued libraries and the internal
  `personal` library that backs each View Personal Space.
- Preserve user configuration during Windows upgrades.

**Rationale:** every later feature is irrelevant if a clean machine cannot install, start, and retain its settings predictably.

### 2. First-class library policy — implemented

- Give every library a stable ID, kind, source paths, intake mode, and metadata policy.
- Keep exactly `catalogued` and `personal` as library kinds. Each enabled
  profile has one user-facing Personal Space backed by a `personal` library;
  sources and devices do not become separate browsing destinations in View.
- Support enriched, local-preferred, local-only, and manual metadata policies.
- Bypass retail, provider, Wikidata, and review-queue work for local-only and manual libraries.
- Keep photo assets outside the work/edition/canonical-claim graph.

**Rationale:** metadata bypass cannot be a late pipeline flag. It changes identity, persistence, readiness, review, and presentation. Making it a library policy prevents home videos and private content from leaking into assumptions made for commercial works.

### 3. Backup and recovery — implemented

- Create consistent SQLite snapshots through the Engine's single-writer boundary.
- Include non-secret configuration and a manifest in each archive.
- Validate archive shape and data-store integrity before staging a restore.
- Apply a staged restore before the data store opens, while preserving the previous file as a recovery copy.
- Expose create, list, download, and restore actions in System settings.

**Rationale:** beta users will test ingestion and matching against real collections. Recovery must exist before encouraging that risk.

### 4. Honest capability surface — implemented

- Remove public actions that return a permanent “not implemented” response.
- Keep unfinished workers private and unregistered until they have a durable workflow.
- Do not expose simulated success or fallback data in the Dashboard.

**Rationale:** an unavailable feature is manageable; a visible action that cannot complete damages trust and makes support harder.

## P1 — Beta Experience and Quality Gates

### 1. Library onboarding and management — implemented

- Provide an empty-library path from Home to Libraries and ingestion.
- Create, edit, and remove custom libraries in Settings.
- Default personal/home-video libraries to local-only behavior.
- Make source path, recursion, read-only behavior, and matching policy visible.

### 2. View Personal Space MVP — foundation implemented, Dashboard partial

- Resolve Shared, Mine, and permitted Profile scopes from trusted profile
  identity before querying content.
- Index configured personal sources in place without provider matching or file
  moves, deduplicating physical bytes while retaining source paths and logical
  ownership.
- Cursor-page a date-grouped timeline and search deterministic local metadata.
- Proxy thumbnails and originals through short-lived, profile-bound,
  same-origin grants rather than exposing Engine credentials to the browser.
- Persist favorite, hidden, archive, trash, and restore state without mutating
  originals.
- Persist Manual and Smart Galleries; Manual Gallery membership is unique and
  Smart Galleries use the shared versioned rule model.
- Read captured date, dimensions, camera details, document text, and GPS when
  locally available.
- Keep administrator scan as a recovery/diagnostic endpoint. Normal View
  onboarding is attaching sources to the profile's Personal Space, not choosing
  among sources or repeatedly starting a manual scan.

The remaining P1 work is connecting all lifecycle, selection, Gallery,
People, Places, and Collection actions in the Dashboard and completing the
responsive/accessibility release gate.

### 3. Regression and release gates — required for every beta candidate

- Restore, warning-free build, and full automated test suite.
- Contract snapshots and storage/integration guardrails.
- Formatting verification and vulnerable-library audit.
- Docker configuration/build and documentation build.
- Representative 1920×1080 screenshots for every changed Dashboard surface, including typography, focus, overflow, empty, and overlay states.

**Rationale:** this is the minimum useful and supportable personal-local-media
experience. It deliberately favors deterministic local indexing over
computationally expensive intelligence.

## P2 — Beta Polish After Real-Library Feedback

Implement these during beta only when telemetry, issue reports, or real collections demonstrate the need.

### 1. Photo operations

- Folder/file change watching rather than periodic reconciliation alone.
- Batch Gallery placement, batch visibility changes, and Manual Gallery ordering.
- Better timezone normalization and explicit “date unknown” grouping.
- RAW/HEIF support based on verified cross-platform decoder availability.
- Thumbnail cache retention, regeneration, and storage diagnostics.

### 2. Library operations

- Per-source indexing history, pause/resume, and more precise failure reporting.
- A preview of how metadata policy affects a file before saving a library.
- Safer path conflict detection across overlapping libraries.
- Import/export of library definitions without secrets.

### 3. Existing media lanes

- Continue data-quality polish for discovery, search ranking, playback, and collection truth.
- Raise automated coverage thresholds as the high-risk ingestion and recovery paths stabilize.

**Rationale:** these features improve efficiency and clarity but do not justify delaying a beta that already indexes safely and exposes truthful states.

## P3 — Post-Beta Photo Intelligence and Sharing

### 1. Local search intelligence

- Local-only face clustering with explicit opt-in, model provenance, and a way to merge or forget identities.
- Object, scene, and OCR indexing with explainable search results.
- A local semantic-search index that can be rebuilt independently of source files.

### 2. Places and memories

- A map surface backed by EXIF coordinates, with privacy controls and coarse-location options.
- Event clustering, trips, “on this day,” and configurable memory generation.
- Editing for captured time, timezone, and location without modifying originals by default.

### 3. Sharing and multi-device workflows

- Public-link Gallery sharing only after authentication, authorization,
  expiration, revocation, and audit logging are production-ready. Selected-profile
  Gallery sharing is the only persisted sharing model in the beta foundation.
- Mobile upload/sync, conflict handling, and resumable transfers.
- Optional video transcodes and motion-photo pairing for photo-library video assets.

**Rationale:** Google Photos/Immich-style intelligence is a separate privacy, model-quality, compute, and security program. It should build on View's isolated local-asset model, not be embedded into catalogue ingestion or block beta safety.

## Release Decision

A beta candidate is ready when P0 and P1 are green on a clean installation and the visual evidence shows no layout regressions. P2 is feedback-driven beta polish. P3 must not hold the beta and should not be marketed as complete until its privacy and accuracy controls are tested with real libraries.
