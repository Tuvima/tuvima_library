# Technical Overview

Tuvima Library is a .NET 10 local-first media system. The product name is Tuvima Library; many projects and namespaces still use `MediaEngine.*`.

## Runtime Apps

| App | Project | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | `src/MediaEngine.Api` | Composition root, API, ingestion, storage wiring, provider integration, AI services, background jobs, health checks, and SignalR |
| Dashboard | `src/MediaEngine.Web` | Blazor Server UI that talks to the Engine over HTTP and SignalR |
| Standalone ingestion worker | `src/MediaEngine.Ingestion` | Worker host for ingestion components; not the primary runtime path today |

Normal local development starts the Engine first, then the Dashboard.

## Main Data Flow

```text
Library folders
  -> File watcher / import scan
  -> Settle, lock check, fingerprint
  -> File processor
  -> Identity/scoring
  -> Retail provider stage
  -> Wikidata bridge stage
  -> SQLite, artwork, organization, write-back
  -> Display/detail/search APIs
  -> Dashboard
```

The Engine owns business rules and persistence. The Dashboard consumes contracts, typed HTTP clients, and SignalR events. Razor components must not contain direct SQL.

## Repository Shape

| Project | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `MediaEngine.Domain` | Core aggregates, entities, enums, constants, and interfaces |
| `MediaEngine.Contracts` | DTOs that cross the Engine/Dashboard boundary |
| `MediaEngine.Application` | Read-model DTOs and cross-layer service contracts |
| `MediaEngine.Storage` | SQLite repositories, schema bootstrap, migrations, configuration loading |
| `MediaEngine.Intelligence` | Priority Cascade, scoring, fuzzy matching, identity matching, collection arbitration |
| `MediaEngine.Processors` | File processors and media extraction helpers |
| `MediaEngine.Providers` | Metadata providers, hydration pipeline, reconciliation, image/person/universe enrichment |
| `MediaEngine.AI` | Local model lifecycle, hardware checks, AI features, Llama/Whisper inference |
| `MediaEngine.Identity` | Profiles, roles, and user identity concepts |
| `MediaEngine.Plugins` | Plugin contracts and plugin metadata |
| `MediaEngine.Api` | API endpoints, DI, hosted services, SignalR, Swagger |
| `MediaEngine.Web` | Dashboard UI, typed clients, route helpers, playback/editing/theming services |

## Current User Surfaces

- `/` - Home/discovery
- `/read` - books and comics lane
- `/watch` - movies and TV lane
- `/listen` - music and audiobooks lane
- `/collections` and `/collection/{id}` - broader rollups and managed collections
- `/search` - cross-library search
- `/details/{entityType}/{id}` plus media-specific detail routes - item and group detail
- `/settings` and `/settings/{section}` - user/admin settings
- `/settings/review` - Review Queue
- `/settings/ingestion` - ingestion operations dashboard

Normal media corrections launch `MediaEditorLauncherService` and `SharedMediaEditorShell` from the surface where the issue appears. Review Queue uses the same editor in review mode.

## Extension Points

- Add supported file formats through processors in `MediaEngine.Processors`.
- Add REST/JSON provider behavior through `config/providers/*.json` where config-driven adapters are sufficient.
- Add deeper provider logic in `MediaEngine.Providers` when a provider cannot be expressed as config.
- Add Dashboard Engine calls through `IEngineApiClient` and `EngineApiClient`.
- Add settings destinations through `SettingsNav` and `Components/Settings`.
- Add plugin capabilities through `MediaEngine.Plugins` and plugin projects.

## Verification Workflow

Minimum verification before finalizing code changes:

```powershell
dotnet restore MediaEngine.slnx
dotnet build MediaEngine.slnx --no-restore
dotnet test MediaEngine.slnx --no-build
./scripts/docs/build-docs.ps1
```

Docs-only changes still need `./scripts/docs/build-docs.ps1`. Broader repo changes should run the full restore/build/test gate.
