# Universal Parameterized Collection System

## Overview

Every collection in Tuvima Library — an album, a TV show, a genre category, a user playlist, an AI recommendation — is a **collection**. A collection is a parameterized query container: a set of normalized filter predicates that resolve to a collection of items. The collection type determines how it looks and who controls it, but the underlying mechanism is always the same.

This model unifies what were previously separate systems (content groups, smart collections, system lists, playlists, AI mixes) into a single architecture. A collection is defined by its **rules** (what items belong), its **type** (how it's presented), and its **placements** (where it appears in the Dashboard).

---

## Collection Rules — The Universal Predicate Model

Every collection stores its membership criteria as a JSON array of predicates. Each predicate is a simple object:

```json
{ "field": "genre", "op": "eq", "value": "Science Fiction" }
```

A collection's full rule set might look like:

```json
[
  { "field": "media_type", "op": "eq", "value": "Movie" },
  { "field": "genre", "op": "eq", "value": "Horror" },
  { "field": "vibe", "op": "in", "value": "atmospheric,tense,unsettling" }
]
```

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `eq` | Equals | `genre eq "Horror"` |
| `neq` | Not equals | `media_type neq "TV"` |
| `contains` | Text contains substring | `title contains "Dune"` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `user_rating gt 3` |
| `lt` | Less than | `duration lt 480` |
| `between` | Range (inclusive) | `year between "1980,1989"` |
| `in` | Any of (comma-separated) | `vibe in "atmospheric,cerebral"` |
| `like` | Pattern match | `author like "Herbert%"` |

### Match Mode

Each collection has a `match_mode` that controls how predicates combine:

- **ALL** (default) — item must satisfy every predicate (AND logic)
- **ANY** — item must satisfy at least one predicate (OR logic)

### Field Vocabulary

Rules reference fields from six categories:

#### Identity fields

| Field | Description | Example use |

## Collection Types — Presentation Hints

The collection type is a **presentation hint** — it tells the Dashboard how to render the collection, who owns it, and what the user can do with it. The underlying rule mechanism is the same for all types.

| Type | Created by | Resolution | Scoped to | Editable | Drillable |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **ContentGroup** | Engine (during ingestion) | Materialized | Library | Read-only | Yes — navigates to sub-page |
| **Smart** | Engine (auto-generated from templates) | Query-resolved | Library | Disable/enable, feature, adjust threshold | No |
| **System** | System (pre-created, always present) | Materialized | User (per profile) | Add/remove/reorder items | No |
| **Mix** | Engine + AI (from taste profile) | Materialized | User (per profile) | Enable/disable | No |
| **Playlist** | User | Materialized | User (per profile) | Full CRUD | No |
| **Custom** | User (via collection builder) | Query-resolved | User (per profile) | Full CRUD + edit rules | No |

### Hybrid Resolution

Collections resolve their items in one of two ways:

- **Query-resolved** — the Engine evaluates the collection's predicates against the data store at display time. Items are always fresh. Used by Smart collections and Custom collections.
- **Materialized** — items are explicitly linked to the collection in the data store. Membership changes when files are ingested (ContentGroup), when the user adds/removes items (System, Playlist), or when the AI refreshes recommendations (Mix).

Query-resolved collections store their predicates in the `rule_json` column. Materialized collections may also have rules (for display purposes or re-evaluation) but their membership is tracked via the `collection_works` junction table.

---

## ContentGroup Collections — Created at Ingestion

ContentGroup collections represent natural groupings that emerge from the media itself: TV shows, music albums, book series, comic series. They are created **during ingestion** by `MediaEntityChainFactory`, not during Wikidata enrichment — so they work immediately when files are scanned.

When a file is ingested:
1. The processor extracts grouping metadata (show name, album name, series name).
2. `MediaEntityChainFactory` checks for an existing ContentGroup collection matching the group identity.
3. If none exists, it creates one with a rule like `{ "field": "series", "op": "eq", "value": "Breaking Bad" }`.
4. The new Work is linked to the collection.

ContentGroup collections have additional fields:
- **`group_by_field`** — the metadata field that defines the group (e.g. `series`, `album`, `show`)
- **`sort_field`** / **`sort_direction`** — default ordering for items (e.g. episode number ascending, track number ascending)

These collections power the **container views** in the Vault's media tabs. When you switch TV to "By Show" view, the table displays ContentGroup collections filtered to TV. Clicking a container navigates to `MediaGroupPage.razor` with the show's seasons and episodes.

### ContentGroup by Media Type

| Media type | Group identity | Sort default | Example |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| TV | Show name | Season → Episode ascending | "Breaking Bad" |
| Music | Album name (+ artist) | Track number ascending | "OK Computer — Radiohead" |
| Books | Series name (+ author) | Sequence index ascending | "Dune Novels — Frank Herbert" |
| Audiobooks | Series name (+ author) | Sequence index ascending | "First Law — Joe Abercrombie" |
| Comics | Series name | Issue number ascending | "Saga — Brian K. Vaughan" |
| Movies | Franchise name | Release year ascending | "Star Wars" |

---

## Smart Collections — Auto-Generated from Library Data

Smart collections are auto-generated from library metadata using templates. One collection is created per qualifying instance (one per genre, one per decade, etc.). Minimum item thresholds prevent clutter from one-off entries.

### Template Categories

| Template | Rule pattern | Default threshold | Media types | Icon |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|------|
| **By Genre: [name]** | `genre eq "{name}"` | 3+ items | Any | Tag |
| **By Vibe: [tag]** | `vibe eq "{tag}"` | 5+ items | Any | Mood/wave |
| **By Author: [name]** | `author eq "{name}"` | 3+ works | Books, Audiobooks, Comics | Person |
| **By Director: [name]** | `director eq "{name}"` | 3+ works | Movies, TV | Person |
| **By Narrator: [name]** | `narrator eq "{name}"` | 3+ works | Audiobooks | Person |
| **By Decade: [period]** | `date_published between "{start},{end}"` | 5+ items | Any | Calendar |
| **Recently Added** | `date_added gt "{30_days_ago}"` | Always shown | Any | Clock |
| **Highest Rated** | `provider_rating gt 4` | Always shown | Any | Star |
| **Unrated** | `user_rating eq "unrated"` | Always shown | Any | Circle-dashed |

Smart collections refresh automatically — their rules are re-evaluated as the library changes.

### Configuration

- **Generation threshold** — adjustable minimum item count per template (default 3 or 5 depending on template)
- **Featured toggle** — pin a collection to appear prominently on the relevant media lane page
- **Enabled toggle** — disable to hide from browsing without deleting

These are managed on the Collections page (`/collections`).

---

## System Lists

Pre-created lists for progress tracking. One per media type family, always present, cannot be deleted. Per-user — each user profile has their own instances.

| List | Media types accepted | Progress tracking | Default "Add to" target for |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Reading List** | Books, Comics | Always on | Books, Comics |
| **Watchlist** | Movies | Always on | Movies |
| **Currently Watching** | TV | Always on | TV |
| **Listening Queue** | Audiobooks, Music | Always on | Audiobooks, Music |
| **Favorites** | Any | Off | None (uses heart icon instead) |

System lists support:
- Add/remove items (via library browsing actions)
- Reorder items (drag to reorder — "I want to read this next")
- Progress tracking per item (not started / in progress / completed, with position)

System lists do not support: rename, delete, change media type scope, creation of new system lists.

---

## Personalised Mixes

Engine-generated per-user collections powered by the AI Taste Profiling feature. Different for every user profile because they reflect individual consumption patterns.

| Mix | Logic | Refresh |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Continue** | In-progress items across all lists | Real-time |
| **Heavy Rotation** | Most consumed in last 30 days | Daily |
| **Discovery Queue** | In your library, matches your taste, untouched | Daily |
| **New For You** | Recently added items matching taste profile | On new ingestion |
| **Because You Liked [X]** | Items similar to a specific highly-rated item (vibe + genre overlap) | On rating change |
| **Taste Mix: [cluster]** | Per taste cluster — your atmospheric sci-fi cluster, your cozy mystery cluster | Weekly |
| **On Repeat** | Current obsessions (high consumption recently) | Daily |
| **Rediscover** | Things you loved 6+ months ago but haven't touched since | Weekly |

Personalised mixes use: genres (from Wikidata/retail), vibe tags (AI-generated), consumption history, user ratings, and the Taste Profile model. See `docs/architecture/ai-integration.md` for the Genre vs Vibe discovery model.

### Configuration

- **Enabled toggle** — per mix type, disable to hide for all users
- No other configuration — the AI handles everything

---

## Playlists & Custom Collections

User-created, user-owned collections. Unlimited in number. Any media type.

### Playlists (Materialized)

Traditional playlists where the user hand-picks items. Items are explicitly linked.

- **Create** — from the My Library page ("+ New Playlist") or the Collections page
- **Rename / Delete** — from within the playlist detail page
- **Add items** — from library browsing via the "Add to Playlist..." picker
- **Remove items** — from within the playlist detail page
- **Reorder** — drag to reorder within the playlist
- **Progress tracking** — optional toggle per playlist
- **Artwork** — auto-composed from items' cover art. User can upload a custom override.

### Custom Collections (Query-Resolved)

Smart collections built with the collection builder. Items auto-populate from user-defined rules. This is the successor to the previous "Smart Playlist" concept — now a first-class collection type rather than a playlist sub-type.

- **Create** — from the Collections page (`/collections`) via the collection builder
- **Edit rules** — from the collection detail page (opens collection builder)
- **Rename / Delete** — from the collection detail page
- **Live update** — items auto-add/remove as they match or stop matching rules (toggleable via `live_updating` flag, default on)
- **Artwork** — auto-composed from matched items' cover art. User can upload a custom override.

Custom collections do not support: manual add/remove of items, manual reordering (sort rules control order).

---

## Collection Builder

The collection builder is an Apple Music Smart Playlist-inspired filter interface for creating Custom collections. It lives on the Collections page (`/collections`) and follows a row-based filter pattern.

### Builder Layout

1. **Collection name** — text field at top
2. **Match mode** — toggle: Match ALL rules / Match ANY rule
3. **Filter rows** — each row is: Field dropdown → Operator dropdown → Value input. Plus/minus buttons to add/remove rows. A "Make group" button creates nested ALL/ANY logic for complex queries.
4. **Live preview** — section below the rules showing how many items currently match and a scrollable list of the first 20 matches. Updates as rules are added or changed. Powered by `POST /collections/preview`.
5. **Limit and sort** — optional item limit (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, or no limit) and sort controls (field + direction)
6. **Live updating toggle** — when on, items auto-add/remove as they match or stop matching rules
7. **Save** — creates the Custom collection

### Field Autocomplete

The value input adapts based on the selected field:
- **Genre, Vibe** — multi-select picker populated from `GET /collections/field-values/genre`
- **Author, Director, Narrator** — person picker with search
- **Media Type** — media type picker
- **Format, Quality** — format/quality picker
- **Series, Universe** — text picker with search
- **Dates** — date picker or duration selector (last N days/weeks/months)
- **Numbers** — numeric input with range support

### Example Custom Collections

| Collection name | Rules | Limit / Sort |
|----------------|-------|--------------|
| "Unread Sci-Fi" | Genre is "Science Fiction" + Completion Status is "Not Started" | Sort by Provider Rating, descending |
| "Short Listens" | Media Type is "Audiobook" + Duration < 8 hours + User Rating > 3 | Sort by Duration, ascending |
| "Atmospheric Horror" | Genre is "Horror" + Vibe includes any of "atmospheric, haunting, unsettling" | Limit 50, sort by Taste Match |
| "Denis Villeneuve Marathon" | Director is "Denis Villeneuve" | Sort by Date Published, ascending |
| "4K Movie Night" | Media Type is "Movie" + Quality is "4K HDR" + Duration between 90–180 min | Sort by Random, limit 10 |
| "New This Month" | Date Added is in the last 30 days + Taste Match > 70% | Sort by Taste Match, descending |

---

## "Add to..." Interaction

When browsing the library (poster cards, detail pages), the user can add items to lists and playlists.

### Primary action (one tap)

Adds to the default system list for that media type. The button label changes based on context:

| Media type | Button label | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Books, Comics | "Add to Reading List" | Reading List |
| Movies | "Add to Watchlist" | Watchlist |
| TV | "Add to Currently Watching" | Currently Watching |
| Audiobooks, Music | "Add to Listening Queue" | Listening Queue |

### Heart action

Separate from the primary action. A heart icon toggles Favorites membership. Available on all media types.

### Secondary action (expand)

Opens a picker showing all materialized collections that accept this media type:
- System lists (with checkmarks for lists the item is already in)
- All user-created playlists
- "Create New Playlist" at the bottom

Smart collections, Custom collections, and personalised mixes do not appear in this picker — you don't manually add to them.

### Where the actions appear

1. **Poster card** — small bookmark/plus icon in the corner (primary action on tap, picker on long-press/right-click). Heart icon separately.
2. **Item detail page** (library page) — explicit button with label + "Add to other list..." secondary action. Heart icon separately.
3. **Vault detail drawer** — not present. The Vault is for management, not consumption.

---

## Progress Tracking

Available on system lists and playlists (when toggled on). Tracks consumption state per item.

### Per-item state

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Not Started** | In the list but untouched |
| **In Progress** | Started — position tracked (page number, timestamp, episode number) |
| **Completed** | Finished |

### Per-collection state

- **Completion percentage** — items completed / total items
- **Items remaining** — count of not-started + in-progress
- **Next up** — the next item based on list order and progress state

### The "Continue" mix

The Continue personalised mix aggregates in-progress items from all system lists and playlists with progress tracking enabled. It surfaces them in one "pick up where you left off" view. It does not duplicate items — it references them from their source lists.

---

## Collection Artwork

Collections are virtual containers — they don't have their own artwork. Artwork is derived from contents.

### Auto-composed artwork

The Engine generates a composite thumbnail from the first few items' cover art (2x2 grid of covers). Refreshes as items change.

### Auto-generated banner

SkiaSharp renders a hero banner (blurred composite of item covers + vignette), same technique used for book hero banners on the Dashboard. Available for all collection types.

### User override

For featured collections or collections the user wants to customise, all five asset types are available (Cover Art, Headshot, Banner, Logo, Backdrop) via the shared Assets section. User uploads take precedence over auto-composed artwork.

---

## Collection Placements — Location as Display Constraint

The `collection_placements` table maps collections to UI locations. A single collection can appear in multiple locations with different display constraints.

### Placement Model

Each placement record contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `collection_id` | Which collection |
| `location` | Where it appears (e.g. `home`, `media_lane_books`, `vault_tv`, `my_library`, `collections_page`) |
| `display_limit` | Maximum items to show at this location (e.g. 10 for a home swimlane, null for full detail) |
| `sort_override` | Optional sort that overrides the collection's default for this location |
| `position` | Display order within the location |

### Location Vocabulary

| Location | What appears there | Collection types shown |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| `home` | Personalised dashboard | Mix, Smart (Recently Added), System (shortcuts) |
| `media_lane_{type}` | Category browsing (e.g. `/books`) | Smart (filtered to media type) |
| `my_library` | Personal collections | System, Playlist |
| `collections_page` | Collections page (`/collections`) | All types |
| `vault_{type}` | Vault container views | ContentGroup (filtered to media type) |

This model replaces hardcoded rules about where each collection type appears. Adding a new location or changing which collections appear where is a data change, not a code change.

---

## The Collections Page (`/collections`)

A dedicated page for browsing, creating, and managing all collection types. This replaces the former Vault Collections tab — collection management now lives at its own top-level route rather than being buried inside the Vault.

### Page Layout

- **Header** — "Collections" title + "New Collection" button (opens collection builder)
- **Type filter chips** — All, Content Groups, Smart, System Lists, Mixes, Playlists, Custom
- **Search** — filter by name
- **Grid/List toggle**

### Grid View

Collection cards showing:
- Auto-composed artwork (or custom override)
- Collection name
- Type chip (colour-coded: blue=Smart, green=System, purple=Mix, amber=Playlist, teal=Custom, slate=ContentGroup)
- Item count
- For ContentGroup: media type chip + creator subtitle

### List View

Table with columns: Artwork, Name, Type, Items, Status, Actions.

### Collection Detail

Click into any collection to see:
- Collection artwork (auto-composed or custom)
- Name, description, type indicator
- Rules displayed as readable chips (for Smart and Custom types)
- Items as a grid or list
- Add/remove/reorder controls (only for System lists and Playlists)
- Progress indicators (only for lists/playlists with progress tracking)
- Configuration controls (thresholds for Smart, rules for Custom, placements for all)

### Navigation

The Collections page is accessible from the LeftDock navigation, positioned between Vault and the provider tester. The LeftDock entry uses a collections/grid icon.

---

## Engine Actions

### Rule Evaluation

`CollectionRuleEvaluator` (Storage layer) translates collection predicates into SQL queries against the data store. It:

1. Parses the JSON predicate array
2. Maps each field to its data store column (joining across works, editions, canonical values, metadata claims as needed)
3. Applies the match mode (AND/OR)
4. Applies sort and limit constraints
5. Returns matching Work IDs

For performance, Smart collections cache a `rule_hash` — the hash of the serialized rule JSON. When rules haven't changed, cached results can be served. The `live_updating` flag controls whether materialized collections re-evaluate on library changes.

### Available Actions

| Action | Method | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Resolve collection items | `GET /collections/resolve/{id}` | Evaluate rules, return matching items |
| Preview rules | `POST /collections/preview` | Evaluate rules without saving — powers the live preview in the collection builder |
| Collections at location | `GET /collections/by-location/{location}` | All collections placed at a UI location, with display limits applied |
| Field values | `GET /collections/field-values/{field}` | Distinct values for a field — powers autocomplete in the collection builder |
| Create collection | `POST /collections` | Create a new collection (Playlist or Custom) |
| Update collection | `PUT /collections/{id}` | Update collection properties or rules |
| Delete collection | `DELETE /collections/{id}` | Delete a user-created collection (Playlist or Custom only) |
| Get placements | `GET /collections/{id}/placements` | Where a collection appears |
| Set placements | `PUT /collections/{id}/placements` | Update collection placements |

---

## Platform Inspiration

The universal collection model draws from patterns proven by major media platforms:

| Platform | Pattern | How it maps to collections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Netflix** | "Because you watched X", category rows, "My List" | Mix (Because You Liked), Smart (genre rows), System (Watchlist) |
| **Spotify** | Daily Mixes, Discover Weekly, user playlists, album pages | Mix (Taste Mix), Mix (Discovery Queue), Playlist, ContentGroup (albums) |
| **Apple Music** | Smart Playlists with field+operator+value rules | Custom collections via collection builder — direct inspiration for the filter UI |
| **Plex** | Auto-generated collections by genre/decade/director, user collections | Smart collections (auto-generated templates), Custom collections |

---

## Data Store Changes (Migration M-070)

New columns on the `collections` table:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `resolution` | TEXT | `query` or `materialized` |
| `rule_json` | TEXT | JSON array of predicates |
| `rule_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 of rule_json for cache invalidation |
| `group_by_field` | TEXT | Field that defines ContentGroup identity |
| `match_mode` | TEXT | `all` or `any` |
| `sort_field` | TEXT | Default sort field |
| `sort_direction` | TEXT | `asc` or `desc` |
| `live_updating` | INTEGER | 1 = re-evaluate on changes, 0 = static |

New table: `collection_placements`

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `collection_id` | TEXT FK | References collections |
| `location` | TEXT | UI location key |
| `display_limit` | INTEGER | Max items at this location (null = unlimited) |
| `sort_override` | TEXT | Optional sort override |
| `position` | INTEGER | Display order |

Backfill migration converts existing collections to the new schema, generating `rule_json` from existing collection properties.

---

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Phase 1 — Foundation** | Collection entity changes, migration M-070, `CollectionRuleEvaluator`, predicate model, actions (resolve/preview/field-values) |

## Wikidata Series Manifests

When a ContentGroup collection has a canonical Wikidata series QID, hydration can attach a factual manifest from Tuvima.Wikidata. The manifest is stored separately from owned Works: owned entries link to local `works`, while missing entries remain lightweight `series_manifest_items` rows with names, QIDs, ordering, parent collection labels, and provenance.

This lets the UI show views such as "owned 2 of 18" for a series without creating fake media assets. For example, an Expanse collection can show owned novels plus missing novels, novellas, and short fiction when Wikidata models them. Manifest warnings indicate Wikidata modeling gaps or local ambiguity; user display overrides may affect presentation, but QID-based manifest facts remain canonical.
