# Tuvima Library Documentation

Tuvima Library is a private, local-first story library. It watches your folders, identifies your media, enriches it with metadata, and presents books, audiobooks, movies, TV, music, and comics as one coherent library.

## How The Product Fits Together

```text
Watch folders
  -> Ingestion
  -> File processors
  -> Identity and scoring
  -> Retail identification
  -> Wikidata bridge resolution
  -> SQLite, artwork, organization, write-back
  -> API and SignalR
  -> Dashboard
```

The user-facing Dashboard is organized around current workflows:

- **Home** for discovery and overview.
- **Read**, **Watch**, and **Listen** for media lanes and shelves.
- **Collections** for broader rollups that connect multiple shelves or user-managed groupings.
- **Search** for cross-library discovery.
- **Detail pages** for viewing items and launching inline corrections.
- **Review Queue** for blocked or uncertain items.
- **Settings/Admin** for configuration and operations.
